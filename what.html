  <p>  <h2><Font face="Comfortaa" color="green" size="6">What is Telegram?</font></p></h2></font>
    <p><br/><font face="PT Sans Narrow" size="5">Telegram is a a cloud based instant messeging app, first started in Russia. It is a open source software. Telegram was designed to be a secure messenger that third-parties wouldn't be able to intercept.
  It was launched by <i>Pavel Durove</i> and his elder brother<i> Nikolai Durove</i> in the year of 2013. Pavel supports the finance and ideology of Telegram and Nikolai created MTProto protocol, which is the basis of this messanger. This is not only open and secure but also allows working with several data-centers.</br>
  Telegram is a brilliant combination of security, reliability and speed on any network. These elements make Telegram more outstanding than any other messeging app. 
  
  
  <br/>
  Since its launch in 2013, Telegram has grown in popularity in the secure messaging category (its developers claim the app has over 200 million users), but with controversy. In addition to technical questions about how safe it truly is for users counting on it to keep their messaging activity private, the app has been in the news for political reasons throughout the first half of 2018. The governments of Iran and Russia have banned Telegram for thwarting them from accessing communications conducted on the app by their citizens and others inside their countries.</p><br/><img style="float: right" src="tele.png" height="300" width="330">
