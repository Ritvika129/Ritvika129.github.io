In October 2014, South Korean governmental surveillance plans drove many of its citizens to switch to Telegram. In December 2014, Telegram announced that it had 50 million active users, generating 1 billion daily messages, and that it had 1 million new users signing up on its service every week; traffic doubled in five months with 2 billion daily messages. In September 2015, an announcement stated that the app had 60 million active users and delivered 12 billion daily messages.

     <br/>On March 14, 2019, Pavel Durov claimed that “3 million new users signed up for Telegram within the last 24 hours.” Durov didn't specify what prompted this flood of new sign-ups, but the period matched a prolonged technical outage experienced by Facebook and its family of apps, including Instagram.</p>
