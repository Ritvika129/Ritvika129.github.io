    <p><br/> <font face="Noto Sans CJK SC Light" size="3">Telegram doesn't it sounds like Instagram? Anyway it sounds like but the real thing is that Telegram is made with very advanced features in it. Telegram uses your smartphone's phone number as your messenger ID. You can share documents and media files with other Telegram users. 
  The Telegram app is available for Android, iOS (iPad, iPhone), Linux, macOS and Windows. It also has a website version that you can use through most browsers.

    <p><h3> ACCOUNTS</h3></p>
  
 <p> Telegram accounts are tied to telephone numbers and are verified by SMS or phone call. Users can add multiple devices to their account and receive messages on each one. Connected devices can be removed individually or all at once. The associated number can be changed at any time and when doing so, the user's contacts will receive the new number automatically. In addition, a user can set up an alias that allows them to send and receive messages without exposing their phone number.</p>
  
  <p><h3>CLOUD-BASED MESSAGES</h3></p>
  
<p>Telegram's default messages are cloud-based and can be accessed on any of the user's connected devices. Users can share photos, videos, audio messages and other files (up to 1.5 gigabyte in size per file). Users can send messages to other users individually or to groups of up to 100,000 members. Sent messages can be edited and deleted on both sides within 48 hours after they have been sent. This gives user an ability to correct typos and retract messages that were sent by mistake.</p><br/> <img src="aa.png" height="500" width="700">
